This directory provides a simple mechanism for implementing a memory cap.
Modules can use the MemoryCap::update_allocations() and
update_deallocations() calls to self-report when they allocate or free
heap memory. If the total memory allocations exceed the configured memory
cap, flow pruning is done to free up additional memory.

This mechanism is approximate and does not directly reflect the activities
of the memory allocator or the OOM killer.

TODO:

- possibly add eventing
