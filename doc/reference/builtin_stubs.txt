JavaScript normalizer has encountered a symbol that is not expected as a part of a valid
JavaScript statement, making further normalization impossible.

119:266

HTML <script> tag must not have a nested <script> tag inside it. If a nested tag is
encountered, this alert is raised.

119:267

This alert is raised when </script> end-tag is encountered inside a JavaScript comment
or literal, which is a syntax error, as the last comment or literal is not closed before
script end. 

119:268

When HTML <script> tag contains a reference to an external script, it must not contain
any executable JavaScript code. This alert is raised if executable (i.e. not comment) code
is found inside a script tag that has an external reference.

119:269

In HTML, a script tag must not be self-closing (written as <script /> without a following
end-tag). If a self-closing "short-form" script tag is encountered, this alert is raised.

119:270

JavaScript normalization includes identifier substitution, which brings arbitrary JavaScript
identifiers to a common form. Amount of unique identifiers to normalize is limited,
for memory considerations, with http_inspect.js_norm_identifier_depth parameter. When this
threshold is reached, a corresponding alert is raised. This alert is not expected for typical
network traffic and may be an indication that an attacker is trying to exhaust resources.

119:271

In JavaScript, template literals can have substitutions, that in turn can have nested
template literals, which requires a stack to track for proper whitespace normalization.
When the depth of nesting exceeds limit set in http_inspect.js_norm_max_tmpl_nest,
this alert is raised. This alert is not expected for typical network traffic and may be
an indication that an attacker is trying to exhaust resources.

Received inconsistent IP options on fragmented packets

123:2

Received indicators of a teardrop attack on fragmented packets

123:3

Received short fragment, possible DOS attempt (possible boink/bolt/jolt attack). The minimum length
required to throw this alert is specified by stream_ip.min_frag_length

123:4

Overlap anomaly: fragment packet ends after defragmented packet

123:5

Received a zero-byte fragment

123:6

Bad fragment size encountered, packet size is negative

123:7

Bad fragment size encountered, packet size is greater than 65536

123:8

123:11

TTL value is less than configured minimum, not using for reassembly. Minimum TTL can be configured
with stream_ip.min_ttl

123:12

Fragment overlap limit exceeded, event will be raised for all successive fragments. The max fragment
overlaps that can occur before alerting is configurable by changing stream_ip.max_overlaps

Received a TCP SYN on an already established TCP session

129:2

Data present on SYN packet

129:3

Data was sent on a stream not accepting data. The stream is in the
TIME-WAIT, FIN-WAIT, CLOSED, or CLOSE-WAIT state

129:4

The TCP timestamp is outside of PAWS (protection against wrapped sequences) window

129:5

Bad segment, adjusted size <= 0 (deprecated)

129:6

Window size (after scaling) is larger than policy allows. stream_tcp.max_window can be increased to
allow for larger window sizes if desired

129:7

Limit on number of overlapping TCP packets per session was reached. stream_tcp.overlap_limit can be increased
to allow for more overlaps per session, if desired

129:8

Data was sent on stream after a TCP reset was sent, and the stream is in
CLOSED state

129:9

TCP client is possibly hijacked, MAC addresses on received packets differ from what was originally
seen on this flow

129:10

TCP server is possibly hijacked, MAC addresses on received packets differ from what was originally
seen on this flow

129:11

129:12

Consecutive TCP small segments exceed the configured threshold. The size required to be a small segment can
be configured via stream_tcp.small_segments.maximum_size, and the maximum number of these small segments can be configured
with int stream_tcp.small_segments.count

129:13

stream_tcp detected a 4-way handshake, which includes a TCP SYN (without ACK) in response to
the initiating client SYN. stream_tcp.require_3whs = 0 should be set to ensure this can be
detected in all cases.

129:14

TCP timestamp is missing, which could cause a failure in PAWS checking,
or RTT calculation

129:15

TCP reset was requested outside window (bad RST)

129:16

TCP Anomaly: FIN number is greater than prior FIN while the connection
is in TIME-WAIT

129:17

TCP Anomaly: ACK number is greater than prior FIN while the connection
is in FIN-WAIT-2

129:18

Data was sent on stream after TCP reset received

129:19

TCP window was closed before receiving data

129:20
